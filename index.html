Abandoned by her father at birth, Lavanya lost her mother too, in an accident seven years ago. But the little girl was lucky to get a second mother. Her maternal aunt Padma adopted her and started bringing her up like her own daughter. Padma works a s a contruction laborer and has to struggle everyday to feed both her daughters Lavanya and Shobha but she never gets tired because she has big dreams for both of them.</p>
                   
                   <p>Lavanya studies in the 4th standard along with Shobha at a Mission education center in Hyderabad. She likes to draw and dance and so does her sister. Lavanya wants to grow up to be a teacher and teach children who do not have the means to pursue an education.</p>

His father who used to work as a daily wage earner passed away when Roshan was in the 6th standard. Before joining in the Mission Education center he along with his mother had to go through very hard times when his father expired and his mother did not have any money to pay the school fees and he had to drop one year. When identified by a project coordinator of the Mission Education center Roshan was a boy with little hope.</p>
                   <p>Soon after joining the center Roshan began to improve in studies, he works harder and never misses a class. He likes to make new friends and read story books. His mother now works to earn for the family and Roshan hopes that someday he will be successful and work of all those children who have to suffer like he did.</p>

Her father who worked as a tailor in a factory nearby lost his hand in an accident which led him to lose his job. Things began to change from then on, Nahid who earlier used to go to a different school had to drop out and so did her brother Adil who began working in a shop to support the family.</p>
                    <p>Nahid was identified by a coordinator from Mission Education who convinced her parents to send her to the center in Ghaziabad. The family is happy that she gets lunch at school and Nahid for the love of her Adil saves kheer form lunch. The family still struggles but Nahid knows that she can make everything go away by working hard at school.</p>

                   <p> Pradip’s parents make a living through boat riding in a small village of Khammam, Telangana, barely earning Rs. 3000 a month. As he grew up, Pradip too started accompanying his parents on their daily rides and would do odd jobs for people, earning a few extra rupees.</p>
                   
                   <p> It took nearly three years of counseling and countless door to door visits by teachers from Mission Education at Telengana to convince Pradip’s parents to send him to school. They had not wanted to part with the little additional income that he had started bringing in. But in the end, when Pradip insisted, they could not say no to their son.</p>
                   
                   <p> Now when Pradip goes with his parents on the boat rides and they hear him talking in English with the tourists, they can’t stop smiling. He has also started teaching some English words to his parents to help them deal better with the tourists.</p>

                   <p> It was through her friends that Mission Education Program of Smile Foundation came to know about Purnima and her brothers. After much discussions and talks with her grandparents Purnima was finally admitted at the centre. She currently studies in class 6, her brother Shubh is in class 3 and another of her brother Som will come to class 1. Very soon their hard work and dreams are going to bear fruit and they are going to be successful.</p>
